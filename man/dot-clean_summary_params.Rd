\title{Clean metadata parameters for summary functions}
\usage{
.clean_summary_params(param_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{param_list}{A named list of metadata parameters.}
}
\value{
A cleaned version of \code{param_list} with unsupported entries removed.
}
\description{
Removes elements from a parameter list that are not safe to include
in \code{summarise_prevalence()} or \code{summarise_outcomes()}. An element is kept if:
\itemize{
\item It is an atomic value of length 1 (e.g., a number or string)
\item It is a single object instance (e.g., an R6 or S3 class object)
}
}
\details{
Elements such as vectors of length > 1 or lists of objects are removed,
and a warning is issued listing the removed keys. This is necessary because
may be helper parameters such as pre-computed lists of which agents are in
which group, e.g., in homophily models.
