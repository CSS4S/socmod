\title{Simulate Feld's 1991 Marketville Network}
\usage{
simulate_feld_1991(seed = 42)
}
\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 42.}
}
\value{
An igraph object representing the simulated network.
}
\description{
Creates an undirected network using the degree distribution from
Feld (1991) based on the "Marketville" high school data. Uses
the configuration model to generate the network structure.
}
\details{
The friendship paradox—where most individuals have fewer friends
than their friends do—emerges naturally due to degree heterogeneity
in this network.
}
\examples{
# Generate the network
g <- simulate_feld_1991(seed = 42)

# Plot degree vs. mean degree of friends to show the paradox
deg <- igraph::degree(g)
mean_neighbor_deg <- sapply(igraph::V(g), function(v) {
  nbs <- igraph::neighbors(g, v)
  if (length(nbs) == 0) return(NA)
  mean(igraph::degree(g, v = nbs))
})

plot(deg, mean_neighbor_deg,
     xlab = "Individual's Friends",
     ylab = "Mean Friends of Friends")
abline(0, 1, col = "red")

# Proportion of individuals with fewer friends than their friends
mean(deg < mean_neighbor_deg, na.rm = TRUE)

}
