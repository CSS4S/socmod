- title: The `AgentBasedModel` class to represent the agents and their social network
  desc: |
    Create and run agent-based models of social behavior in socmod.
  contents: AgentBasedModel
- title: Running single model trial or trial ensembles
  desc: |
    The `run_trial()` and `run_trials()` functions use the specified `partner_selection`, `interaction`,  and `iterate_model` functions to specify these dynamics and iterate the `model` (an instance of `socmod::AgentBasedModel`). `fixated` helps us tell when all agents are performing the same behavior, i.e., the population has fixated.

  - Trial
  - run_trial
  - run_trials
  - fixated
- title: Learning (strategy) functions
  desc: |
    Functions to pass to run for model iteration in a learning model,  and for either success-biased or frequency-biased adaptive learning.
  contents:
  - iterate_learning_model
  - starts_with("success_bias")
  - starts_with("frequency_bias")
  - starts_with("contagion_")
- title: Agents and their neighbors
  desc: |
    Agents in the model are represented by a number of attributes, with select class methods to track lists of their neighbors.
  contents:
  - Agent
  - Neighbors
- title: Networks
  desc: |
    Create networks, including a growing suite of network construction routines.
